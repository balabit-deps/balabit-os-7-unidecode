Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.
